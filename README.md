A [Home Assistant][hass] component for controlling LG HVAC devices via their SmartThinQ platform, based on [WideQ][].

[hass]: https://home-assistant.io
[wideq]: https://github.com/wkd8176/wideq

Here's how to use this:

1. Install [WideQ][] by typing something like(You may need sudo permision.):
smartthinq_hvac
       $ cd ~/.homeassistant
       $ mkdir wideq
       $ git clone https://github.com/wkd8176/wideq.git wideq
       $ cd wideq
       $ pip3 install -e .

2. Clone this repository into your `~/.homeassistant` directory

       $ cd ~/.homeassistant
       $ git clone https://github.com/wkd8176/hass-smartthinq.git

3. Authenticate with the SmartThinQ service to get a refresh token by running the WideQ example script. (Eventually, I would like to add a feature to the Home Assistant component that can let you log in through a UI, but I haven't gotten there yet.) Run this in the `wideq` directory:

       $ python3 example.py

   The script will ask you to open a browser, log in, and then paste the URL you're redirected to. It will then write a JSON file called `wideq_state.json`.

   Look inside this file for a key called `"refresh_token"` and copy the value.
   
   And you can find another json file called `my_device_list.json`, there is your device info and mac address.

4. Add a stanza to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` like this:

       smartthinq:
         token: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
       climate:
         - platform: smartthinq
           name: DEVICE_NAME_WHAT_YOU_WANT
           mac: YOUR_DEVICE'S_MAC_ADDRESS
       sensor:
         - platform: smartthinq
           name: DEVICE_NAME_WHAT_YOU_WANT
           mac: YOUR_DEVICE'S_MAC_ADDRESS

5. Add include files to your include folder or something you have

   Start up Home Assistant and hope for the best.
